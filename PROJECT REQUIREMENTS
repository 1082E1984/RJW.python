this is to list project requirements and details for the project BrieXLreplace
this project is in the Education space, located in the state of Florida, in the United States
customer has 600-750 xl  workbooks with a worksheet with an incorrect spelling in one cell ( this is a MERGED cell)
xl books are in ONE folder, and are located on the clients google drive 
Client has worked this with Java script and is trying to design a working script , and has reached a dead end.
the find and replace will work for ONE workbook and one XL file, on one worksheet.   It will not do multiple sheets

CLIENT EXAMPLE/ ATTEMPT

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42150450/google-apps-script-for-multiple-find-and-replace-in-google-sheets -- 
this will look in a SINGLE workbook for a thing, and then replace it .... but it won't search through the whole Drive folder.

and Ron Wilkins at 	Ms Wilkins <ms.wilkins@bailesbears.org> 
  

So what needs to be done : 

Find the word DEVELOPEMENT and replace with DEVELOPMENT in cell H34:M34 ( it's a merged cell ) on multiple workbooks, 
all contained within a drive folder ( if you mark 'put folder ID here', I know how to find a folder ID ),
